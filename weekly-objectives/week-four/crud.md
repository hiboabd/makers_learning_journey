## Broader goal - week 4
### * Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships) *

### CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete

These are four fundamental ways we interact with databases.

When we are building APIs, we want our models to provide four basic types of functionality. The model must be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources.

The CRUD paradigm is common in constructing web applications, because it provides a memorable framework for reminding developers of how to construct full, usable models.

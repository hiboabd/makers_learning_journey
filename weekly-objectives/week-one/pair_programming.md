## Broader goal - week 1
### * Pair using the driver-navigator style *

### Week one reflections

Although it is early days, I have started to gain a better understanding of what feels like an effective pair programming session for me.

  1. For example, I know that I prefer to push and pull on Git as a pairing approach vs. controlling the screen remotely.
  2. I prefer to regularly switch roles with my pair partner. This enables both parties to code and drive equally.
  3. I feel it is important/useful to keep communicating with your partner, even to fairly extreme lengths. For example, as a driver, you could read the task aloud for the benefit of you both. As a navigator, you can communicate the exact steps the driver needs to take, including trivial ones (e.g. open atom). This will probably need to be adapted depending on my pair partners style but I feel it works particularly well for me.

In future sessions, I'd like to work on the following:

  1. Pair programming can be difficult when the task requires knowledge you haven't yet gained. It can be tempting to just try and find the solution to the code but I need to determine how I can keep the focus of the session on learning.
  2. When to give and receive feedback and what feedback is most useful? Is it feedback on pairing or feedback on process or code? or all?

### Week two reflections

I found it easier to work through the challenge this week, yay!

  1. I also learnt that I value the following qualities in a pair partner: communication, equal opportunity to contribute, comfort, sense of humour, patience. I feel these qualities bring out the best in both partners.
  2. It is best to slowly go through a task and make sure both parties are comfortable with the material - focus on learning not speed or any expectancy of how much should be completed in the allocated time frame.


### Personal do's and don'ts

#### Do's
  1. Do take regular 5-10 min breaks (e.g. every 30-40 minutes)
  2. Do regularly push to GitHub (after each task)
  3. Do screen share during the session
  4. Do regularly switch navigator/driver roles - (recommend after each task)
  5. Do pair by pushing and pulling on GitHub vs. controlling other pairs screen.
  6. Do make sure you are all set before the session begins (e.g. links needed are open and ready)


#### Dont's
  1. Don't spend longer than 20 minutes debugging. If a solution cannot be found, check the walkthrough and make sure the solution is understood before moving on.
  2. Where possible, don't pair program by controlling the other persons screen as this prevents practising git pull and push. Also, it is more effortful to fork the and clone the repository later and you may end up with lots of repositories on your local computer or on your Github desktop page.

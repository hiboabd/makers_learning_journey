## Broader goal - week 3
### * Follow an effective debugging process for web applications *

### What is debugging?
Tightening the loop and getting visibility (on the web).

  - Tighten the loop (find the exact line the bug is coming from)
  - Get visibility (use p to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)
  - Once you know the one thing that is wrong, out of place, misspelled, or not giving you what you expect, try to fix it.

The scope for debugging web applications is larger: 

Tightening the loop across the whole web stack: from the browser, to a template, to a controller, to a Ruby object, to a test.
Using error messages and p to get visibility in templates, controllers, Ruby objects and tests.

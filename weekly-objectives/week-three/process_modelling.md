### Define process modelling as a tool to describe and understand a process.
### Use process modelling to further your understanding of HTTP requests and responses.

A process model is a diagram/performance/[or something else] that demonstrates how a process works.

#### Why model a process?

  1. It's a quick way to figure out and cement your understanding of how a process works. It's much quicker than writing the code that enacts the process.

  2. It's much easier to iterate on a process model than the code that enacts the process.

  3. It's much easier to add detail to a process model than to add it to code.

  4. It's a great way to communicate and discuss a process with another person.


#### What forms can a process take?

Many forms!

  1. A boxes and arrows diagram.

  2. An interpretive dance.

  3. A performance where each person is a thing in the process (a server, a GET request).

  4. A form of your own invention.

Rule of thumb: If it makes sense to your team, it's probably a good model!
